I’m not a successful trader. In fact, I haven’t made any money trading yet. I’ve been losing money in the stock market, trying my hand at swing trading. So, why should you keep reading this post? Simple. Unlike other posts or YouTube videos, I haven’t made it in the trading business, and I’m not rich. Instead, I’m here to share my journey with you, showing every step of the way, my progress, my failures, and so on.

You’ve probably seen content creators boasting about their large trading profits, yet they spend an awful lot of time creating videos to "help" you become a trader. Seems a little off, right? Why not spend that time trading since they’re supposedly awesome at it? And the best part is when they try to sell you a book or a digital PDF. It’s like saying, “Let me help you get rich, but first, make me rich.”

Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure some traders out there produce good content, and I’ll point out a few that I’m currently following, but first I need to vet them for some time before I feel comfortable recommending them. However, I’m very wary of such content because, based on my experience, it’s not always about helping you. They might give you some good hints, but at the end of the day, it’s about grabbing your attention for their bottom line.

It seems like their plan has good hints but never encompasses the entire picture. There’s always a step missing or information missing, making it difficult for someone without their resources to replicate their success. They have more capital to invest, stronger networks, and more time to dedicate, but what about those of us starting from scratch? How do we overcome the barriers they don’t face?

So, what makes this post any different? Simple. I’m in the same boat as you if you’re trying to become a successful trader. I’m not here to tell you how to do it. I’m here to share my journey with you.

**So, what's in it for me?** The main reason I’m spending time posting while I could be trading is accountability and community. Sharing my journey publicly keeps me accountable and forces me to reflect on my strategies and decisions. Additionally, by sharing my experiences, I can connect with others who are on a similar path, learn from them, and potentially avoid common pitfalls. Engaging with a community of like-minded individuals can provide valuable insights and support that you might not get from trading in isolation.

There is a higher likelihood that I would fail. According to some statistics, only about 10-20% of swing traders are successful. Also, the idea is to fail fast. So, if I put a year’s worth of trading in and lose most of my money, it’s time to call it quits. But I will reassess then. I need to do it on a daily basis to give it a real try. I hope sharing my experiences, strategies, resources, and hard-learned lessons will help you out.

I plan to leverage my coding and automation experience, along with some AI, to help me out. I'll be sharing these tools with you once I see positive results. The idea is to save us time on the mundane stuff, allowing us to focus on making better trading decisions. More on that in later posts.

My goal from swing trading is to generate a second income. I don’t necessarily believe I’ll become a full-time trader; it could happen, but I’m not sure I even want that. The jury’s still out on that. But my first question is, can swing trading be a reality where I can actually generate a decent second income?

As I enter my 40s crisis (cue the humor {{< emoji "zany_face" >}} ), I’ve started to realize that I’m at least halfway through my lifespan, assuming I live to 80. If I’m not going to enjoy life now, then when? At 75? Will I make it that long? Will I be healthy? Most importantly, do I really want to take that chance?

I need extra income so I can plan trips, build projects that I enjoy, like a kitchen patio or a car project, and buy a camper and some new gadgets. The point is I want to enjoy the present, the now, while still not increasing my workload by an extra 20 hours a week. I call it the 1:1 ratio: for every 1 hour you spend, you make $x amount of money. I want to generate extra income that, with time, turns into a 1:5 ratio, where money is making me money. More like a passive income, but different. Instead of making $100 an hour, I could spend an hour deciding and making a new trade that could generate $500 in profit. Hence, the 1:5 ratio, for example. That’s important.

I’m not 20 years old anymore, and time is precious. It gets more and more important as we, or I, get older. I need to balance my time, keep my current career, while building a new income that’s not a 1:1 ratio so I still have time left to enjoy now. If I were to get another job, I’d be working 80 hours a week, which defeats the purpose of having quality of life since there’d be no time to enjoy it.

I simply want to be part of those 10% that makes it. Is it easy, no. Will I make it, maybe. Is it worth it, absolutely. I hope you join me in this journey and share your experiences, strategies, and resources. Let’s make it together.
