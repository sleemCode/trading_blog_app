### My Journey as a Beginner Trader

I’m not a successful trader. In fact, I haven’t made any money trading yet. I’ve been losing money in the stock market, trying my hand at swing trading. So, why should you keep reading this post? Simple. Unlike other posts or YouTube videos, I haven’t made it in the trading business, and I’m not rich. Instead, I’m here to share my journey with you, showing every step of the way, my progress, my failures, and so on.

### The Problem with Trading Gurus

You’ve probably seen content creators boasting about their large trading profits, yet they spend an awful lot of time creating videos to "help" you become a trader. Seems a little off, right? Why not spend that time trading since they’re supposedly awesome at it? And the best part is when they try to sell you a book or a digital PDF. It’s like saying, “Let me help you get rich, but first, make me rich.”

### Trusting the Right Sources

Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure some traders out there produce good content, and I’ll point out a few that I’m currently following, but first I need to vet them for some time before I feel comfortable recommending them. However, I’m very wary of such content because, based on my experience, it’s not always about helping you. They might give you some good hints, but at the end of the day, it’s about grabbing your attention for their bottom line.

### The Missing Pieces in Trading Advice

It seems like their plan has good hints but never encompasses the entire picture. There’s always a step missing or information missing, making it difficult for someone without their resources to replicate their success. They have more capital to invest, stronger networks, and more time to dedicate, but what about those of us starting from scratch? How do we overcome the barriers they don’t face?

### Why This Blog Is Different

So, what makes this post any different? Simple. I’m in the same boat as you if you’re trying to become a successful trader. I’m not here to tell you how to do it. I’m here to share my journey with you.

### What's in It for Me?

The main reason I’m spending time posting while I could be trading is accountability and community. Sharing my journey publicly keeps me accountable and forces me to reflect on my strategies and decisions. Additionally, by sharing my experiences, I can connect with others who are on a similar path, learn from them, and potentially avoid common pitfalls. Engaging with a community of like-minded individuals can provide valuable insights and support that you might not get from trading in isolation.
