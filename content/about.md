Hey there! I'm Raja, a software engineer with a passion for technology and a knack for solving complex technical problems. Over the past 11+ years, I've dabbled in everything from Java and Python to Flutter and beyond. I'm all about making processes more efficient and building tools to boost productivity. Automation is my mantra, and I'm constantly finding ways to save time and improve workflows.

As I approach my 40s {{< emoji "zany_face" >}} I've realized the importance of budgeting and investing for a secure future. For me, retirement isn't about lounging on a beach all day. It's about breaking free from the 50-hour workweek and the 9-to-5 grind. I dream of taking long vacations, spending quality time with my family, and working on projects that truly excite me, all on my own schedule.

I'm a newbie in the world of investing and trading, just starting to learn the ropes. I'm excited to share my journey with you all and hope to leverage my professional skills to succeed in this new endeavor.
